                       default ones (time interval and active on/off)
        - active: if False, do not record data until self.active set to True.
        - continuous: if True, take data as fast as possible from sensor.
        - warnings: if True, print warnings of Timer (e.g. loop too short).
        - precise: if True, use precise timer in oclock (see oclock.Timer).
        - programs: iterable of programs, which are object of the
